Project Overview
This repo is a step-by-step frontend project that teaches solid HTML/CSS foundations through building a responsive landing page (desktop + mobile). You will create a header/hero, several content sections, forms, a footer, CSS-only shapes, animations, and a small JavaScript hamburger menu. Each numbered task builds on the previous one — files for each step are provided so you can progress incrementally.

Goal: produce a clean, accessible, responsive landing page that matches the provided Figma designs and the provided screenshots.
